# Movie Recommendation System 🎬

Welcome to my **Movie Recommendation System** project! This system uses machine learning to recommend movies based on user input. I’ve used data cleaning techniques and a similarity-based algorithm to generate recommendations.

## Overview 🌟

This project allows users to select a movie and receive recommendations for similar movies. The core of the system involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleaning raw movie data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Recommendation Model**: Building a model based on movie similarity.
- **Pickle File**: Saving the trained model for faster predictions.
- **Streamlit UI**: A simple web interface to interact with the system.

## Features 🛠

- Cleaned movie dataset for accurate analysis.
- **Movie Similarity**: Recommends movies based on cosine similarity between movie features.
- Fetches real-time **movie posters** using the **TMDb API**.
- Easy-to-use **Streamlit interface** for quick interaction.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Data Cleaning**: I cleaned the raw dataset to handle missing values and remove duplicates.
2. **Modeling**: I built a recommendation engine based on movie similarity using a cosine similarity algorithm.
3. **Prediction**: The model is saved as a **pickle file** and is used to predict similar movies when a user selects one.
4. **UI**: The front-end is built with **Streamlit**, providing a simple and interactive interface.
